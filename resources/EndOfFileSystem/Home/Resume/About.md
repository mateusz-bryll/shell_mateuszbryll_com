## About

Hello! I'm Mateusz, a seasoned software engineer passionate about crafting innovative solutions.
With over eight years of experience in software development, I've journeyed from the trenches of
.NET and Angular development to the leadership role of an Engineering Manager.

Throughout my professional journey, I've had the privilege of contributing to many projects,
each one a unique opportunity to flex my technical muscles and deliver high-quality solutions.

One of my true passions is the practice of Domain Driven Design, a methodology that empowers me
to create elegant, maintainable, and scalable software architectures. It's this blend of technical
know-how and a commitment to best practices that drives me to continuously push the boundaries of
what's possible in the world of software engineering.
