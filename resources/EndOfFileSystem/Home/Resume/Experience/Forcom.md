## Forcom

I began my journey at Forcom as a Software Engineer in July 2017, joining the Perspectiv product team,
which comprised a team leader, five software engineers, and two manual testers. From the outset,
my responsibilities included spearheading the containerization and migration of the Perspectiv UI
to Angular, alongside developing and maintaining a large project for multiple customers.

In March 2019, I transitioned into the role of a Product Manager, taking charge of the
Pingo Doce & GO NOVA project. This transition allowed me to apply my technical knowledge and
leadership skills further while overseeing this innovative project. Simultaneously, I continued
to be responsible for training .NET software engineers in Angular, enhancing their proficiency
in this technology.

### Key technologies utilized

I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of technologies throughout my career,
including Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. My experience extends to
DevOps tools like TeamCity and GitLab, where I have leveraged GitLab CI for continuous integration
and deployment.

In programming, I have excelled in C#, Oracle, and PostgreSQL for robust database solutions,
alongside Redis for efficient caching. On the front end, I have demonstrated proficiency in
Angular, harnessing its capabilities to create dynamic user interfaces with technologies such as
NGRX, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Key responsibilities

I have undertaken a pivotal role in implementing and evolving large-scale systems with a user base
of approximately 14 million individuals. My expertise extends to programming in the .NET Framework,
encompassing C#, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Redis, while on the front end, I've excelled in Angular,
utilizing technologies such as Angular 8+, Redux, TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS.

In addition, I've played a crucial role in advancing our Continuous Integration pipeline,
leveraging Docker, Kubernetes, and GitLab for seamless development and deployment. My work adheres
to the SCRUM methodology, featuring two-week sprint cycles managed via Redmine. I've contributed
significantly to project documentation on Confluence and have been actively involved in gathering
and analyzing technical requirements.

Collaboration has been at the heart of my responsibilities, as I've worked closely with
cross-functional teams. My role has included architectural design, task allocation to development,
deployment, and Quality Assurance teams, and continued programming in the .NET Framework and
Angular, ensuring the successful delivery of complex projects.
