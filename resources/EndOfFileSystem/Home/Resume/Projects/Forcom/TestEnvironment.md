## Automated test environment

I spearheaded the development of an automated test environment built on a Kubernetes cluster.
The initial distributed test environments required manual configuration of multiple services
within a complex IT system developed by numerous programming teams, each using various languages.
The outcome of this project was the standardization of application configurations and the
implementation of virtualization using Docker containers.

Subsequently, configurations for the system, delivered to various clients, were codified
(Infrastructure as Code) and handed over to the testing department. In collaboration with the IT
infrastructure team, existing test servers were consolidated into a single Kubernetes cluster.
Through the implementation of these solutions, administrators were able to focus on maintaining
the standard cluster infrastructure. At the same time, the testing department saw a dramatic
reduction in the time required to launch a complete test environment, from several days to just
a few hours.

### Key Achievements

* I standardized application configurations and introduced Docker container-based virtualization.
* I implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices for efficient management.
* I consolidated test servers into a Kubernetes cluster, significantly reducing environment setup times.

This project showcases my ability to streamline complex test environments, optimize resource utilization, and leverage Kubernetes for efficient infrastructure management.
