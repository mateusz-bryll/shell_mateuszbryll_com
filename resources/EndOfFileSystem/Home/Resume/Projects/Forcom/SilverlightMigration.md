## Silverlight application migration

In this project, I took on the challenge of migrating an application that had been in development
since 2012, using the outdated Silverlight graphical interface, to the modern Angular framework.
My primary goal was to ensure seamless system operation while transitioning to Angular for future
development, gradually filling the gaps in functionality left by Silverlight.

### Key Achievements

* I successfully integrated Silverlight components with Angular, preserving critical system functionality.
* I meticulously outlined a migration plan for the gradual transition.
* I ensured the continuity of the application's performance while unlocking the potential for new features and enhancements using Angular.

This project exemplifies my expertise in managing complex migrations, maintaining system stability, and evolving applications with cutting-edge technology.
