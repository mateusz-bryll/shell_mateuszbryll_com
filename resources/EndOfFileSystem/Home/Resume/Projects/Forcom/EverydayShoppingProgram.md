## “Everyday Shopping” Program

I worked on the Caritas Polska “Everyday Shopping” program, which aims to provide special Prepaid
cards for daily shopping to seniors facing challenging situations. The central system receives
annual funding from the Biedronka Foundation, distributed to those in need through regular transfers
to the issued cards.

The project's focus was ensuring all Caritas Polska facilities had access to a management panel
for the cards. Additionally, it involved defining monthly top-up amounts and ensuring a secure
integration with the payment system deployed in stores.

### Key Achievements

* I successfully implemented the program using ASP.NET Core and the Angular framework.
* I enabled Caritas Polska facilities to manage the cards efficiently.
* I ensured the secure integration of the system with the store's payment infrastructure.

This project exemplifies my commitment to using technology to improve the lives of those in need,
with a focus on efficiency and security in the process.
