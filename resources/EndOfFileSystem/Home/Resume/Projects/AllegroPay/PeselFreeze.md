## Integration with PESEL Number Reservation Register

I led the integration of Allegro Pay's systems with the Rejestr Zastrzeżeń Numerów PESEL (PESEL
Number Reservation Register), a service provided by the Ministerstwo Cyfryzacji (Ministry of
Digital Affairs). This project was critical to comply with new regulations aimed at preventing
identity theft and fraud, with a strict implementation deadline.

The Rejestr Zastrzeżeń Numerów PESEL is a governmental register that allows individuals to flag
their PESEL numbers, preventing unauthorized use in financial agreements. As of June 1, 2024,
financial institutions are mandated to verify the status of a PESEL number before entering into
certain contracts, such as loans or credit agreements. Failure to comply can result in the inability
to enforce claims arising from such agreements.

I managed the end-to-end integration process, which included:
- Cross-functional collaboration: Coordinated efforts between development, compliance, and legal
teams to ensure all aspects of the integration met regulatory standards.
- Technical implementation: Oversaw the development of secure APIs to interface with the
Ministry's register, ensuring real-time verification capabilities.
- Regulatory compliance: Ensured that the system adhered to the legal requirements set forth by
the Ministry of Digital Affairs, meeting the strict deadline of June 1, 2024.

### Key Achievements

The successful integration enabled Allegro Pay to:
- Met the regulatory requirements by the mandated deadline, avoiding potential legal and financial
penalties.
- Improved the security of financial transactions by preventing unauthorized use of PESEL numbers,
thereby protecting customers from identity theft.
- Seamlessly incorporated the verification process into existing systems without disrupting services.

This project underscores my ability to lead complex integrations under strict regulatory deadlines,
ensuring compliance and operational efficiency. Also, once again, it showcased my project management
skills, such as leading a multidisciplinary team and coordinating with external governmental bodies.
