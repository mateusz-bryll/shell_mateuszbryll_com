## Onboarding and Customer processes

As the manager responsible for the Onboarding Process at Allegro Pay, I oversee a crucial phase of
our operations. This process seamlessly guides new users through creating an account, completing
the worthiness assessment, and establishing their user identityâ€”all achieved through a
straightforward and user-friendly form.

Within the Customer Processes area, I oversee all aspects of the customer journey after the
onboarding phase. This encompasses various post-sales activities and interactions, including account
management, support, and service delivery. This area plays a pivotal role in the success and
satisfaction of our customers and contributes significantly to the overall performance of
Allegro Pay.

Both of these areas are fundamental to the functioning and growth of Allegro Pay. I am committed
to ensuring that they operate efficiently, effectively, and in alignment with our strategic goals.
