## Docker

### ╰ Dockerfile, Layers, Lightweight images

󱗼 **Proficiency:** *Expert - used for commercial projects since 2017*
> I employ **Docker** as a critical tool in my development workflow in DevOps and containerization.
> 
> I craft efficient **Dockerfiles** using best practices, such as careful **layers planning**,
> installing dependencies without caching, and utilizing the lightweight **Alpine Linux**
> distribution whenever feasible.
> 
> Additionally, I optimize Dockerfiles with **multi-stage builds** to ensure lean and efficient
> container images. I also specialize in **publishing .NET** applications as platform-specific
> containers, enhancing compatibility and performance.
> 
> Docker serves as my primary environment for CI/CD pipelines, enabling seamless automation of
> deployment processes.
> 
> Furthermore, I leverage Docker for integration testing, ensuring consistent and reliable
> application performance across various environments.

## Kubernetes

### ╰ Kubeadm, Ingress, Helm, Deep understanding of Kubernetes architecture

󱗼 **Proficiency:** *Intermediate/Advanced - used for production hosting*
> In Kubernetes orchestration, I demonstrate proficiency in creating and managing clusters using
> platforms cloud platforms and self-hosted solutions.
> 
> I implement essential features such as *Liveness**, **Readiness**, and **Startup Probes* and
> define **CPU and memory limits** for resource allocation.
> 
> I use **cert-manager**, which is seamlessly integrated with the **Ingress** controller.
> This integration is configured to work with **ACME Certificate Authorities**.
> 
> I employ **Helm** charts to streamline deployment and management, ensuring consistency and
> efficiency in complex environments.
> 
> Furthermore, I possess a deep understanding of **Kubernetes architecture**, encompassing control
> planes and worker nodes, and I implement **autoscaling** and **load-balancing** strategies to
> optimize application performance.

## Cloud technologies

### ╰ AKS, Azure DNS, EKS, Route 53

󱗼 **Proficiency:** *Expert - deep understanding of PKI and DNS, commercial use in many products*
> I used platforms like **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)**, **EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)**.
> My deployments of cert-manager is complemented by **Azure DNS** or **Route 53** to enable the automatic
> **DNS01 ACME challenge** to renew certificates.

## Git

### ╰ Git CLI, Submodules, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps

󱗼 **Proficiency:** *Expert - used since 2016*
> In my Git repositories, I employ best practices to maintain an organized and efficient codebase.
> I utilize a **mono repo** structure and **Git submodules** for modular code management.
> 
> My repositories encompass not only application code but also infrastructure components - **IaC**.
> 
> I'm proficient in Git platforms like **GitHub**, **Azure DevOps** and **GitLab**, where
> I practice effective version control and collaboration.
> 
> **Pull Requests** are a vital part of my workflow, ensuring code quality and collaboration when
> working within a team. This approach extends to application code and infrastructure configurations,
> creating a seamless and reliable development environment.
