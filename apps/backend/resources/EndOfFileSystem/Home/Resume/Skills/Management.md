## Feedbacks

### ╰─ Robert Rabiega - Senior Product Manager at Allegro Pay

> I consider you a mature leader and a role model when it comes to leadership skills. You know the
> strengths of each team member and work on developing them, e.g., by giving them responsibility
> for leading initiatives. You know when to show the way, motivate, and make tough decisions when
> the situation requires it. Thanks to this, the challenges faced by the team:
> - personnel shortages;
> - manual work;
> - the necessity to create an MVP and often accept technical debt;
> 
> are well-managed, allowing us to accomplish our plans in the area of compliance and deliver
> projects such as:
> - anti-usury initiative;
> - collecting missing data;
> - data synchronization;
> - preparation for DSA implementation.
> 
> I greatly value our meetings because they provide me with a broader perspective and allow me to
> learn new ways of problem-solving from you. You are proactive in seeking improvements to the
> team’s work, consistently implementing changes such as sticking to sprint capacity, maintaining
> DoR and DoD, or proposing the “wrzutki” category to assess the impact of tasks outside the
> backlog. These initiatives enable better work planning and more accurate estimates, which
> translate into a realistic approach to the roadmap.
> 
> Our joint work on organizing the backlog allows for a more holistic approach to developing our
> products. I know I can rely on your domain knowledge, and your suggestions regarding technical
> or infrastructural solutions are thoughtful and accurate. This is also evident in the significant
> authority you hold within the team.

> Mateusz, we have been working together for over 12 months. You are the best team leader I have
> had the pleasure of working with.
> 
> - You possess extensive knowledge, which you willingly share.
> - You understand business processes and how our changes impact them.
> - You exhibit great maturity.
> - All the decisions you make are thoughtful and take into account all aspects (technical,
> business, and human).
> - You actively propose solutions and improvements.
> - From my perspective, implementing changes resulting from the Anti-Usury initiative (which
> critically impacted Allegro Pay's processes) would not have been as seamless and stress-free
> without your involvement.
> 
> You actively participated in and led analyses and actions to ensure not only timely but also the
> best possible solutions. As a result, the process works flawlessly and does not negatively impact
> our business outcomes.
> 
> You manage and lead the team excellently. All meetings with you and your team are productive and
> conducted in a great atmosphere. There is room for discussion, raising concerns, and sharing
> ideas. It’s clear that everyone is respected and their opinions matter.
