## Production process monitoring (SCADA)

In the second project, I took on the challenge of designing a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition) system. This system was pivotal in monitoring and managing a complex production line.
To achieve real-time monitoring, I utilized AngularJS to develop a web application. This application
could be displayed on TVs throughout the facility via integrated web browsers. The system
incorporated SVG graphics to represent the various devices on the production line. Leveraging
SignalR, I implemented a solution that provided instantaneous device status updates and enabled
the monitoring of material levels in real-time.
