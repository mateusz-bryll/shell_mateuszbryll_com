## Components library

As the Lead Software Engineer, I had the opportunity to spearhead the development of
ComponentsLibrary, a robust framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development,
deployment, and maintenance of applications. Built alongside the main auction platform,
this initiative aimed to establish a set of generic services, tools, and best practices that
empowered developers to deliver high-quality solutions with ease.

### Framework Highlights

ComponentsLibrary encompassed a wide array of essential .NET components, including:
- CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) for managing complex application logic.
- Integration Events to enable seamless communication across services.
- Secure Connections, Messaging, and Authentication/Authorization for high-security requirements.
- A Modular Monolith architecture supporting Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns.

This framework enabled developers to bootstrap new services rapidly, connecting them to existing infrastructure while adhering to proven best practices.

### Generic microservices

The second phase of the project involved developing generic microservices, such as FileStore,
Chat, and Reporting. These services were designed with two modes of operation:
- Stand-alone mode via Docker containers.
- Integrated mode through dedicated NuGet packages, allowing easy inclusion in other microservices.

An automated pipeline ensured that these services were built, tested, and published to the
company’s private NuGet feed. This streamlined distribution made it simple for developers to adopt
these components across various projects.

### Frontend support with Angular UI components

To ensure seamless integration on the frontend, I led the development of reusable Angular UI
components. This allowed developers to integrate backend features effortlessly into their
applications, further enhancing productivity and consistency.

### Key Achievements

- ComponentsLibrary transformed the way applications were built and deployed in the organization.
- By providing a standardized approach, it reduced development time, improved code quality, and
empowered teams to focus on delivering value.
- The framework’s modular design ensured scalability and reusability, setting a solid foundation for
future projects.
