## Saltrex Waste â€“ Auction System

I spearheaded the development of a B2B auction platform compliant with the latest EU waste management
guidelines. This system finds optimal waste management solutions for goods damaged during
transportation or excess production.

The application was built using ASP.NET Core WebAPI and MS-SQL on the server side and Angular,
along with additional frameworks such as Angular Material, SCSS, and Redux (NGRX) on the client side.
The entire environment was deployed to a Kubernetes cluster as part of the Azure Kubernetes Service
(AKS), with monitoring implemented using the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana). Here are some
screenshots of the application UI:

### Key Achievements

* I designed and developed a platform aligned with EU waste management regulations.
* Using cutting-edge technologies, including ASP.NET Core, Angular, and Kubernetes, ensured scalability and robust performance.
* Elastic Stack monitoring provided real-time insights into system health and performance.

This project showcases my expertise in building complex, regulation-compliant platforms and my proficiency in utilizing modern technology stacks for scalable and efficient solutions.
