## Pingo Doce & GO NOVA

I led the development of the pilot autonomous store, Pingo Doce & Go NOVA, situated on a university
campus near Lisbon, in collaboration with Jerónimo Martins Group. This groundbreaking project
allowed customers to scan products and make payments from their phones independently. The launch
of this project was a significant milestone for the Jerónimo Martins Group, with the number of
customers served on opening day far exceeding that of traditional Pingo Doce stores.

The system was built using the .NET framework and utilized a Redis database. The first
Pingo Doce & Go store opened on Thursday, October 3rd, 2019, in Carcavelos, close to Lisbon,
on the Nova School of Business and Economics campus. Thanks to advanced in-store technology,
this 24-hour store allowed customers to shop quickly without waiting in lines.

sector.
