## Implementation of the Anti-Usury Act

As an Engineering Manager, I led the design, implementation, and rollout of Allegro Pay's Anti-Usury
Process, ensuring compliance with Poland's Anti-Usury Act. This complex, high-stakes initiative
required coordinating multiple teams, managing a strict legal deadline, and delivering a robust,
ready from day one system aligned with the organization's critical payment infrastructure.

This project was critical to ensure Allegro Pay's compliance with regulations that introduced
stringent caps on fees and required thorough creditworthiness assessments. My responsibilities
included:
- Breaking down complexity: I decomposed the larger issues into smaller, manageable problems,
demonstrating my ability to lead and organize complex, multi-faceted projects effectively.
- Long-term commitment: From business analysis and defining technical requirements to presenting
them to the team and monitoring work schedules, I was deeply involved at every stage. The entire
process spanned several months.
- Critical infrastructure expertise: The solution required the use of my unique experience in
building highly available distributed systems located on a critical payment path, ensuring the
system's reliability and scalability.

By dividing the project into stages and closely monitoring progress through team data, we accurately
estimated and implemented the solution on time, allowing space for testing and improvements.

### Team leadership

Throughout the project, I ensured alignment across teams and maintained a productive and motivated
workforce:
- Team coordination: I was in constant contact with the Product Manager, reporting progress during
weekly meetings, advising on required actions, and ensuring cross-team collaboration.
- Knowledge sharing: I conducted event-storming workshops at every stage to level up knowledge
within and outside my team, creating a culture of shared understanding.
- HR topics: As the direct manager, I focused on maintaining high team satisfaction through
bi-weekly health checks and solving current challenges. Task satisfaction and technical development
consistently received high ratings (averaging 4.2 to 5.0 on a 6-point scale).

Despite the complexity of legislative topics, I ensured that every team member had opportunities
for growth and skill development. Additionally, technical training sessions I organized were
well-received and contributed to both individual and organizational growth.

### Key Achievements

The implementation was a success, with the following outcomes:
- Delivered the solution on time, meeting strict legal deadlines while maintaining the highest
quality standards.
- Ensured the process worked flawlessly, without errors or negative impacts on Allegro Pay's
business outcomes.
- Fostered a positive, collaborative, and innovative team environment, with team satisfaction
scores consistently high (5.8 to 6.0 on a 6-point scale).

This project exemplifies my ability to lead teams through high-pressure, complex initiatives while
ensuring operational excellence, legal compliance, and team satisfaction.
