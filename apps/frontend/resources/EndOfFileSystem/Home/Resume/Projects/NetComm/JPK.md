## JPK files reporting

The first project was the development of a desktop application designed to streamline the process
of reporting JPK FA and JPK MAG files to the Polish Tax Office. This application served as a
critical tool for the Chief Accountant. I used the MahApps Metro WPF and Ninject Dependency
Injection, I created a user-friendly interface for reporting, and the application's core logic was
implemented through T-SQL stored procedures within the database.
