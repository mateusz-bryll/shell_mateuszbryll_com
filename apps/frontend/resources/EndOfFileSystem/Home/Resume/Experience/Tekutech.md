## Teku.tech Poland

As a Lead .NET and Angular Software Engineer, I assumed a multifaceted role encompassing
team leadership, application architecture, and hands-on development. I operated within a dynamic
team of three software engineers, a product owner, and a product manager.

My tenure at Teku.tech Poland spanned from November 2019 to June 2022, during which I assumed
responsibility for the Saltrex Waste system. From the project's inception, I played a pivotal role
in shaping its trajectory. This included active involvement in requirements gathering, meticulous
business process modeling, and formulating a compelling value proposition.

As the project evolved, I transitioned into the development and testing phases, where I engineered
a framework tailored to expedite the construction of a microservice architecture. This framework
seamlessly integrated CQRS and Event Sourcing methodologies, amplifying our development efficiency
and ensuring robust system performance.
