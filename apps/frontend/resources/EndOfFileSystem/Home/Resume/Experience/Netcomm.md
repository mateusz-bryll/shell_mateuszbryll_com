## NetComm Technologies

As an Application Developer at NetComm Technologies, I embarked on my professional journey, working
from April 2016 to May 2017. In this role, I was responsible for designing and implementing desktop
and web applications using technologies such as .NET (C#, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET WebAPI, SQL) and
Angular. Additionally, I played a vital role in creating technical project documentation and
collaborating effectively within a team. This early experience laid the foundation for my subsequent
roles in the tech industry.

### Key technologies utilized

At NetComm Technologies, I engaged in the development of both web and desktop applications. For our
desktop applications, I utilized WPF and MahApps Metro, complemented by an extensive MS SQL database,
with the core logic implemented through T-SQL stored procedures. On the web front, I leveraged
ASP.NET MVC and AngularJS to create dynamic web applications hosted on IIS, and for real-time
communication with the front end, SignalR was my tool of choice.

### Key responsibilities

My responsibilities at NetComm Technologies encompassed a range of tasks, including the design and
implementation of both desktop and web applications. This involved extensive programming in the
.NET ecosystem, employing C#, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET WebAPI, and SQL for database operations.
Additionally, I worked with Angular to create dynamic web solutions. I also played a crucial role
in preparing comprehensive technical documentation for each project and fostered effective
collaboration within the team.
