## Allegro Tech Talks #35

### *Cracow, Mar 23, 2023*

During Allegro Tech Talk #35 held at the Cracow office, I presented on optimizing .NET application
performance. My talk delved into utilizing the Span<T> type in .NET and offered practical methods
for its integration into the codebase. Following the presentation, attendees enjoyed delicious
pizza and engaged in in-depth discussions. For those who couldn't join us in Cracow, I've shared
a video of the presentation, allowing them to access the insights from the comfort of their home.

## SysOps/DevOps MeetUp #61

### *Warsaw, Jan 25, 2024*

During the presentation, I focused on a practical look at application containerization, using an
application based on the .NET Framework as a case study. I focused on the points where developers
work interfaces with infrastructure elements, highlighting how and why developers use Kubernetes
clusters and Docker. The main goal was to indicate how containerization affects the everyday work
of developers, how it contributes to more effective cooperation with DevOps teams, and what can be
expected from such collaboration.
